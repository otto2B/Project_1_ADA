# A temporal and geographical analysis of food consumption

### Abstract
-Idea: analyse the Open Food Facts data through different prisms: chronologically 
(even though the project only started in 2012), geographically and also from a business perspective (Brands analysis). 
We thus hope to find different outcomes depending on these three factors and be able to draw interesting conclusions...
-Goals: be able to draw conclusions over several topics: first of all, health. But also financial and ecological findings. 
Three topics that appear critical to us today.
Also, we would like to make the database more interactive, with quizzes, games or interactive graphs for example.
-Motivation: health, ecology and budgets are to be three major topics in the near future. They represent major concerns 
for a large share of the population and are closely linked to the food consumption and more globally the food business. 
Moreover, we like the idea of a collaborative and decentralized database.

### Research questions
-How to get rid of duplicates ? How to favour those that are more detailed ? 
-How to manage missing values in products ?
-How can we compare two products ? how can we handle the different gradings (e.g. ‘a’ to ‘e’, in france) that exist ?
-To what extent does this database represent the global food consumption (can we find biasses 
with the type of users in the database, etc.)
-Can we identify food trends depending on the region ? (more fat or more sugar in certain countries)
-Or even ecological trends (foodprints, packaging)
-Is there a change in the consumption of certain types of ingredients throughout the years ? (increase in palm oil 
or in sugar?)
-Does a country have a tendency to drink more alcohol, soda, sweet drinks?
-Which brands outsource manufacturing, use cheaper packaging and ingredients, are more eco-friendly?

### Dataset
-Open food facts dataset: we intend to mainly use the following features: nutrition facts, additives, ingredients 
from palm oil, carbon footprint, nutrition scores, countries, fruit-vegetables score, origins, purchase places, 
manufacturing, datetime   
-WHO list of carcinogenic products and/or other in order to add health and ecological dimensions to our first dataset
-We might use the Instacart dataset if we find that the open food facts dataset does not provide enough information 
on consumption behavior. However, this dataset is limiting because it is not global (only U.S.), and we think that it 
might be biased regarding the type of people who order food online (more orders of unhealthy people?).

### A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
-Mining WHO data
-Filter the Open food facts dataset, and keep only the columns which are relevant to our analysis
-For each analysis question, check if there is enough data to get pertinent and unbiased results
-Look into ways we can visualize our data.
-Discuss layout of our data story

### Questions for TAs
-How can we link this database to health or ecological issues ? Can we use a WHO list of carcinogenic products for example ? 
-Are there any ways that are in our reach for implementing interactive graphs?
