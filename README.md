# Difference and similarities between the American and French way ofconsuming food

# Abstract
This document presents a full report on similarities and differences between how the United States and France consume food. We explore the range of food products sold in these two countries, and try to see if there are any significant nutritional differences. We also decide to analyse the ecological footprint of food manufacturers in both of these countries, as ecology is a very relevant matter. We do this by taking a look at the packaging materials used by the major food manufacturers. We will also talk about some limitations that we have encountered in our dataset that might affect our results.

# Research questions
